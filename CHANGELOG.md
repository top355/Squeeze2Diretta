# Changelog

All notable changes to squeeze2diretta will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-05

### UPGRADE NOTICE
When upgrading from v1.0.0, you must delete the old configuration files
before running install.sh, as the configuration file format has changed:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop squeeze2diretta
sudo rm -f /opt/squeeze2diretta/squeeze2diretta.conf
sudo rm -f /opt/squeeze2diretta/start-squeeze2diretta.sh
```
Then re-run `install.sh`. Your previous settings will need to be re-entered
in the new configuration file.

### Fixed
- **First track crackling/noise** on Audiolinux and RPi systems
  - Root cause: race condition between audio data arriving on stdout and format
    detection via stderr. Diretta was opened at default 44100Hz before the actual
    format was known, causing wrong-format audio to reach the DAC.
  - Fix: wrapper now waits for first track format detection before streaming.
    `g_current_sample_rate` initialized to 0 (was 44100) so the first track
    always triggers the reopen+burst-fill path with the correct format.
- **DSD noise/hiss** caused by byte-order mismatch (PR #3, SwissMountainBear)
  - Squeezelite packs DSD bytes MSB-first into uint32_t but outputs S32_LE,
    so bytes arrive reversed on the pipe. Added byte-swap during de-interleave.
- **PCM buffer margins** increased for better resilience on systems with
  different scheduling characteristics (RT kernels, slower CPUs)
  - `PCM_BUFFER_SECONDS`: 0.3s -> 0.5s
  - `PCM_PREFILL_MS`: 30ms -> 50ms
- **DSD playback broken when `-a 24` was set** (DSD files played as PCM at 352.8kHz)
  - Root cause: wrapper incorrectly converted S32_LE to packed S24_3LE (3 bytes/sample)
    but DirettaSync always expects 4-byte padded input for 24-bit audio.
  - Fix: removed wrapper-side bit depth conversion; DirettaSync handles 32→24/16 conversion
    internally via `configureRingPCM(inputBps=4, direttaBps=3)`.
- **PAUSE_ON_START not working** since start script changes
  - Root cause: `sleep 0.5` was too short; squeezelite hadn't registered with LMS yet.
  - Fix: polls LMS CLI (`players 0 100`) every 2s until player appears (max 30s).
- **Build failure on pre-AVX2 x86 CPUs** (x86-64-v2 variant)
  - Root cause: `DirettaRingBuffer.h` defined `DIRETTA_HAS_AVX2=1` for all x86 platforms,
    causing AVX2 intrinsics to be compiled even without `-mavx2` compiler flag.
  - Fix: guard now requires both x86 platform AND `__AVX2__` compiler define.
  - CPUs without AVX2 (pre-Haswell/Skylake) now use scalar fallbacks correctly.

### Added
- **Burst-fill mechanism** for format transitions (SwissMountainBear)
  - Fills ring buffer at full pipe speed before playback begins
  - Escapes "equilibrium trap" where push rate equals pull rate
- **Clock family detection** for PCM-to-DSD transitions within same 44.1/48kHz family
- **Two-tier close**: lightweight `close()` for format transitions, full `release()` for shutdown
- **`-W` option** (squeezelite WAV/AIFF header parsing)
  - Reads format from WAV/AIFF headers instead of trusting server parameters
  - Configurable via command line (`-W`) or config file (`WAV_HEADER=yes`)
  - Disabled by default (may help with format detection issues on some setups)
  - Suggested by Filippo (GentooPlayer)
- **TARGET_MARCH** cmake option for cross-compilation (for Audiolinux/Piero)
- **ARM64 page size detection** using `getconf PAGESIZE` (Filippo/GentooPlayer)
- **`-a` option** (PCM bit depth) for DACs not supporting 32-bit
  - Sets Diretta output bit depth to 24-bit or 16-bit (DirettaSync handles conversion internally)
  - Configurable via command line (`-a 24`) or config file (`SAMPLE_FORMAT=24`)
  - Default: 32 (no conversion)
- **PAUSE_ON_START** option to pause playback on service start
- **Auto-open config editor** after installation

### Changed
- Reduced buffer sizes for lower latency (SwissMountainBear):
  - DSD: 2.0s -> 0.8s, PCM: 2.0s -> 0.5s
- install.sh refactored to use `cp` from systemd/ directory (SwissMountainBear)
- PCM rate changes now use full SDK close/reopen for clean transitions

- Reads PCM/DSD audio from pipe
- Converts interleaved to planar format for DSD
- Streams to Diretta Target using DIRETTA::Sync API

### Dependencies
- Diretta Host SDK 147 or 148 (must be downloaded separately)
- Squeezelite with native DSD support (setup script included)
- CMake 3.10+, C++17 compiler
