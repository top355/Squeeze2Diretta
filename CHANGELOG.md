# Changelog

All notable changes to squeeze2diretta will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - Unreleased

### Added

**Centralized Log Level System:**
- New `LogLevel.h` header with 4 levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- `-q` / `--quiet` option: show only warnings and errors (WARN level)
- `-v` continues to work as before (DEBUG level)
- Default level (INFO) produces the same output as v2.0.0
- All source files migrated from per-file `DEBUG_LOG`/`DIRETTA_LOG` macros to unified log levels
- In `NOLOG` builds, all logging macros compile to no-ops

**Runtime Statistics via SIGUSR1:**
- Send `kill -USR1 <pid>` to dump live statistics to stdout
- Shows: playback state, current format, buffer fill level, MTU, stream/push/underrun counters
- Useful for monitoring production systems via systemd journal

**MS Mode Active Logging:**
- Verbose log now shows the actual MS mode negotiated with the Diretta Target
- Three lines: supported modes, requested mode, and active mode
- Resolves uncertainty when target doesn't report supported MS modes

### Fixed

**Atomic Ordering Fix in RingAccessGuard:**
- Changed `fetch_add` from `memory_order_acquire` to `memory_order_acq_rel`
- Ensures the increment is visible to the reconfiguration thread on all architectures (ARM64)

### Changed

**Production Build in install.sh:**
- `install.sh` now configures CMake with `-DNOLOG=ON` by default (disables SDK internal logging)
- Application-level logging (`-v`/`-q`) remains fully functional
- New `NOLOG` CMake option added to `CMakeLists.txt`

**Updated systemd Configuration:**
- `squeeze2diretta.conf`: documented `-q` option alongside `-v`
- `start-squeeze2diretta.sh`: passes `$VERBOSE` value directly instead of hardcoded `-v`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-14

### UPGRADE NOTICE
v2.0 requires a **new patched squeezelite** with in-band format headers.
You MUST rebuild squeezelite using the updated `setup-squeezelite.sh`.
The old `squeezelite-stdout-flush.patch` is replaced by `squeezelite-format-header.patch`.

```bash
# Remove old squeezelite and rebuild
sudo systemctl stop squeeze2diretta
rm -rf squeezelite/
./setup-squeezelite.sh
```

### Changed
- **In-band format signaling (breaking change)**: squeezelite now writes a 16-byte
  binary header ("SQFH") to stdout at each track boundary, containing sample rate,
  bit depth, DSD format, and channel count. The wrapper reads this header synchronously,
  eliminating the stderr log parsing race condition that caused most v1.x bugs.
- **Consumer-driven flow control**: replaced `sleep_until()` rate limiting with
  event-based backpressure using DirettaSync's `waitForSpace()` / `notifySpaceAvailable()`
  mechanism. The Diretta SDK's actual consumption rate drives data delivery, reducing
  timing jitter from ±2ms to ±50µs for smoother audio streaming.
- **Removed stderr monitoring**: the wrapper no longer parses squeezelite's stderr
  logs for format detection. Squeezelite's stderr now passes through to the parent
  process for debugging visibility.
- **Simplified process setup**: only one pipe (stdout) instead of two (stdout + stderr).
  No more stderr monitor thread, atomic globals, drain logic, or extreme transition delays.
- **Gapless playback**: same-format track transitions are detected via header comparison
  and handled without reopening Diretta (quick resume).
- **Buffered pipe reader**: new `PipeReader` class with peek support for reliable
  header detection mid-stream.

### Fixed
- **Format transitions (DSD↔PCM)** now use full SDK close/reopen with fresh
  `openSyncConnection()` for clean state, fixing noise and wrong-speed playback
  on repeated transitions.
- **Missed format changes**: `PipeReader::readUpTo()` now scans for embedded SQFH
  headers within pipe data, preventing them from being consumed as audio data.
  This was the root cause of the DAC staying locked at the first track's format.

### Removed
- `monitor_squeezelite_stderr()` function and thread
- `g_need_reopen`, `g_format_pending`, `g_is_dsd`, `g_dsd_format_type`, `g_current_sample_rate` atomics
- Stderr pipe creation and redirect
- Pre-format data drain logic
- `sleep_until()` time-based rate limiting (replaced by consumer-driven flow control)
- Extreme transition delays (PCM→DSD: 50ms, DSD→PCM: 80ms)
- Initial "wait for format" spin-loop (replaced by blocking header read)
- `squeezelite-stdout-flush.patch` (replaced by `squeezelite-format-header.patch`)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **24-bit PCM noise/distortion when LMS digital volume is not 100%**
  - Root cause: squeezelite outputs MSB-aligned S32_LE (24-bit data left-shifted by 8).
    When LMS applies digital volume, the multiplication introduces non-zero noise in
    the LSB byte (byte[0]). The S24 auto-detection in DirettaRingBuffer saw both LSB
    and MSB bytes as non-zero and incorrectly defaulted to LsbAligned, extracting
    bytes [0,1,2] instead of [1,2,3]. This shifted every sample by one byte position,
    producing loud noise.
  - Affected: 24-bit sources (e.g., 96kHz/24-bit FLAC from Qobuz) with digital volume
    control active. 16-bit sources were unaffected (16-bit left-shift by 16 keeps
    byte[0] at zero even with volume applied).
  - Fix: wrapper now hints `MsbAligned` to DirettaSync after each `open()` call.
    `detectS24PackMode()` returns `Deferred` (instead of `LsbAligned`) for the
    ambiguous both-non-zero case, allowing the hint to take precedence.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-05

### UPGRADE NOTICE
When upgrading from v1.0.0, you must delete the old configuration files
before running install.sh, as the configuration file format has changed:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop squeeze2diretta
sudo rm -f /opt/squeeze2diretta/squeeze2diretta.conf
sudo rm -f /opt/squeeze2diretta/start-squeeze2diretta.sh
```
Then re-run `install.sh`. Your previous settings will need to be re-entered
in the new configuration file.

### Fixed
- **First track crackling/noise** on Audiolinux and RPi systems
  - Root cause: race condition between audio data arriving on stdout and format
    detection via stderr. Diretta was opened at default 44100Hz before the actual
    format was known, causing wrong-format audio to reach the DAC.
  - Fix: wrapper now waits for first track format detection before streaming.
    `g_current_sample_rate` initialized to 0 (was 44100) so the first track
    always triggers the reopen+burst-fill path with the correct format.
- **DSD noise/hiss** caused by byte-order mismatch (PR #3, SwissMountainBear)
  - Squeezelite packs DSD bytes MSB-first into uint32_t but outputs S32_LE,
    so bytes arrive reversed on the pipe. Added byte-swap during de-interleave.
- **PCM buffer margins** increased for better resilience on systems with
  different scheduling characteristics (RT kernels, slower CPUs)
  - `PCM_BUFFER_SECONDS`: 0.3s -> 0.5s
  - `PCM_PREFILL_MS`: 30ms -> 50ms
- **DSD playback broken when `-a 24` was set** (DSD files played as PCM at 352.8kHz)
  - Root cause: wrapper incorrectly converted S32_LE to packed S24_3LE (3 bytes/sample)
    but DirettaSync always expects 4-byte padded input for 24-bit audio.
  - Fix: removed wrapper-side bit depth conversion; DirettaSync handles 32→24/16 conversion
    internally via `configureRingPCM(inputBps=4, direttaBps=3)`.
- **PAUSE_ON_START not working** since start script changes
  - Root cause: `sleep 0.5` was too short; squeezelite hadn't registered with LMS yet.
  - Fix: polls LMS CLI (`players 0 100`) every 2s until player appears (max 30s).
- **Build failure on pre-AVX2 x86 CPUs** (x86-64-v2 variant)
  - Root cause: `DirettaRingBuffer.h` defined `DIRETTA_HAS_AVX2=1` for all x86 platforms,
    causing AVX2 intrinsics to be compiled even without `-mavx2` compiler flag.
  - Fix: guard now requires both x86 platform AND `__AVX2__` compiler define.
  - CPUs without AVX2 (pre-Haswell/Skylake) now use scalar fallbacks correctly.

### Added
- **Burst-fill mechanism** for format transitions (SwissMountainBear)
  - Fills ring buffer at full pipe speed before playback begins
  - Escapes "equilibrium trap" where push rate equals pull rate
- **Clock family detection** for PCM-to-DSD transitions within same 44.1/48kHz family
- **Two-tier close**: lightweight `close()` for format transitions, full `release()` for shutdown
- **`-W` option** (squeezelite WAV/AIFF header parsing)
  - Reads format from WAV/AIFF headers instead of trusting server parameters
  - Configurable via command line (`-W`) or config file (`WAV_HEADER=yes`)
  - Disabled by default (may help with format detection issues on some setups)
  - Suggested by Filippo (GentooPlayer)
- **TARGET_MARCH** cmake option for cross-compilation (for Audiolinux/Piero)
- **ARM64 page size detection** using `getconf PAGESIZE` (Filippo/GentooPlayer)
- **`-a` option** (PCM bit depth) for DACs not supporting 32-bit
  - Sets Diretta output bit depth to 24-bit or 16-bit (DirettaSync handles conversion internally)
  - Configurable via command line (`-a 24`) or config file (`SAMPLE_FORMAT=24`)
  - Default: 32 (no conversion)
- **PAUSE_ON_START** option to pause playback on service start
- **Auto-open config editor** after installation

### Changed
- Reduced buffer sizes for lower latency (SwissMountainBear):
  - DSD: 2.0s -> 0.8s, PCM: 2.0s -> 0.5s
- install.sh refactored to use `cp` from systemd/ directory (SwissMountainBear)
- PCM rate changes now use full SDK close/reopen for clean transitions
